# Scottish Walks
[Webapp](https://scottish-walks.streamlit.app/) to view walks in Scotland and allow filtering based on user preferences such as duration, total elevation, and number of Munros climbed. Data from [walkhighlands.co.uk](https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk).

The motivation for this project is that no current website allows for multiple user filters at once. This is a simple, user-friendly approach that allows users to view walks across the country or a specific area, and filter based on a number of individual preferences.
